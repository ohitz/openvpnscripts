Some stuff for OpenVPN.

## create-client-profile.sh

`create-client-profile.sh` creates a unified .ovpn file containing a
configuration as well as all necessary certificates and keys. Useful for
sending to a client.

Copy `client-profile-template.txt.dist` to `client-profile-template.txt` and
edit it to your requirements. If required, change the script as well.
